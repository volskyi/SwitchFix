# Keep SwitchFix's own LaunchServices registration consistent.
#
# When both dist/SwitchFix.app (a local build) and /Applications/SwitchFix.app
# exist, LaunchServices may resolve ua.volskyi.switchfix to the dist copy, which
# confuses TCC and can crash Apple's SecurityPrivacyExtension when the
# Privacy & Security pane loads. This script unregisters the dist copy so
# only the installed app remains registered.
#
# Only ua.volskyi.switchfix is touched. We deliberately do NOT reset TCC entries
# for other applications: `tccutil reset` would revoke live permissions for
# apps that are still installed, and macOS cleans up orphaned TCC records for
# apps you uninstalled automatically (or they remain inert).
